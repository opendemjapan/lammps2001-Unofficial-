LAMMPS Units

This file describes the units associated with many of the key
variables and equations used inside the LAMMPS code. Units used for
input command parameters are described in the input_commands file. The
input command "units" selects between conventional and Lennard-Jones
units.  See the force_fields file for more information on units for
the force field parameters that are input from data files or input
scripts.

Conventional units: 
    
    distance = Angstroms 
    time = femtoseconds 
    mass = grams/mole 
    temperature = degrees K 
    pressure = atmospheres 
    energy = Kcal/mole 
    velocity = Angstroms/femtosecond 
    force = grams/mole * Angstroms/femtosecond^2 
    charge = +/- 1.0 is proton/electron

LJ reduced units: 
    
    distance = sigmas 
    time = reduced LJ tau 
    mass = ratio to unitless 1.0
    temperature = reduced LJ temp 
    pressure = reduced LJ pressure 
    energy = epsilons 
    velocity = sigmas/tau 
    force = reduced LJ force (sigmas/tau^2) 
    charge = ratio to unitless 1.0

This listing of variables assumes conventional units; to convert to LJ
reduced units, simply substitute the appropriate term from the list
above. E.g. x is in sigmas in LJ units. Per-mole in any of the units
simply means for 6.023 x 10^23 atoms.
