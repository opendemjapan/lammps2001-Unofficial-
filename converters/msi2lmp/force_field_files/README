This is a convenient directory where Accelys (nee Biosym) force
files (e.g. cvff.frc and cff97.frc) can be placed for use by msi2lmp.

We do not distribute these files with LAMMPS because Accelys sells
them as part of their molecular modeling packages.  If you are using
the msi2lmp tool, presumably you already have these Accelys files on
your system.
