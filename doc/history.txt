History of LAMMPS

This is a brief history of features added to each version of LAMMPS.

** LAMMPS 2001 - November 2001
    
    F90 + MPI version of code 
    
    dynamic memory, no param.h file settings to twiddle, see "extra memory"
    command

    changed required ordering of some input script commands (see discussion in
    input_commands file)
    
    new commands: "extra memory", "maximum cutoff", "restart version",
    "angle coeff", "dihedral coeff", "improper coeff",
    "volume control", "slab volume", "rotation zero"
    
    changed meaning or syntax of commands:
    "special bonds", "fix style rescale", "fix style hoover/drag",
    "temp control rescale", "press control", "restart"
    
    deleted commands: "log file", "press_x control" (and y,z)
    
    better match to CHARMM force fields via "nonbond style lj/charmm",
    "coulomb style charmm/switch", "angle style charmm", dihedral style charmm"
    (due to Mark Stevens and Paul Crozier)
    
    changed "special bonds" default to 0.0 weighting on 1-4 interactions for
    CHARMM compatibility, added "special bonds amber" option for AMBER
    compatibility
    
    ghost atoms and new treatment of periodic boundary conditions, 
    this allows for cutoffs > box-size and faster neighbor binning,
    binned neighbor list construction is now the default as it is almost
    always faster
    
    perform blocked-input from data and restart files, faster for many MPI 
    implementations (due to Mathias Puetz)
    
    added Velocities option to data file to initialize each atom's
    velocity (see data_format file)
    
    pressure control was decoupled from temperature control, so that
    constant NPH simulations can be run (not just NPT), temperature 
    controls such as rescale or Langevin can now be used with constant P
    simulations (due to Mark Stevens)
    
    temperature rescaling (either in "temp control" or "fix style rescale")
    has an added fractional parameter which allows it to be applied
    in a lightweight or heavy-handed way to induce the desired temperature
    
    got rid of crib.html file, see global.f for documentation of all 
    variables
    
    2-d slab Ewald and PPPM option, (see "slab volume" in
    input commands) (due to Paul Crozier)
    
    new multiharmonic dihedral and cvff improper force-field options
    (due to Mathias Puetz)
    
    SHAKE constraint for small clusters of atoms, see "fix style shake"
    and "assign fix bondtype" commands
    
    added option to output restart files with timestep stamp or to toggle
    between 2 files, see "restart" command
    
    tools for converting to/from other MD program formats:
    msi2lmp (updated by John Carpenter),
    lmp2arc (due to John Carpenter),
    amber2lammps & dump2trj (Python scripts due to Keir Novik)

    tools for creating and massaging LAMMPS data and restart files:
    setup_lj, setup_flow_2d, setup_chain, peek_restart, restart2data,
    replicate

** LAMMPS 99 - June 99 
    
    all-MPI version of code (F77 + C + MPI) for maximum portablility 
    
    only one PPPM choice now, the better of the two earlier ones 
    
    PPPM uses portable FFTs and data remapping routines, written in C w/ 
    MPI, can now use non-power-of-2 processors and grid sizes 
    
    auto-mapping of simulation box to processors 
    
    removed a few unused/unneeded commands (bdump, log file, id string, 
    limit) 
    
    changed syntax of some commands for simplicity & consistency
    (see input commands) 
    
    changed method of calling/writing user diagnostic routines to be 
    simpler 
    
    documentation in HTML format 

** Version 5.0 - Oct 1997 
    
    final version of class II force fields (due to Eric Simon)
    
    new formulation of NVE, NVT, NPT and rRESPA integrators (due to
    Mark Stevens)
    
    new version of msi2lmp pre-processing tool, does not require DISCOVER 
    to run, only DISCOVER force field files (due to Steve Lustig)
    
    energy minimizer, Hessian-free truncated Newton method
    (due to Todd Plantenga)
    
    new pressure controllers and constraints (due to Mark Stevens)
    
    replicate tool for generating new data files from old ones

    rRESPA (due to Mark Stevens)
    
    new data file format

    full Newton's 3rd law (doubled communication) 
    
    dumping of atom positions and velocities 
    
    restart files
