LAMMPS 2001 examples

The input and sample output files are in several directories.  Each
test case has an input script (in.*), an input data file (data.*), and
one ot more logfile outputs (log.*).  The suffix on the logfiles gives
the machine and # of processors it was run on.

These are the machines for which results are included:

sgi = SGI O2 workstation, R10000 proc
janus = Intel Tflops machine, 333 MHz Pentium procs, fast proprietary network
ross = CPlant cluster, 500 MHz DEC Alpha EV6 procs, Myrinet network

** lj

2048-atom ternary Lennard Jones mixture
data file created using tools/setup_lj.f

in.lj.nve		baseline NVE ensemble
in.lj.nvt		NVT ensemble
in.lj.npt		NPT ensemble
in.lj.fix		temperature rescaling via "fix style" and "assign fix"
in.lj.langevin		Langevin temperature control
in.lj.min		a minimization, followed by a dynamics run
in.lj.neighbor		N^2 neighboring for NPT, instead of binning
in.lj.neighbor_newton	N^2 neighboring with newton flag off in NPT simulation
in.lj.newton		turn newton flag off in NPT simulation
in.lj.volume		use "volume control" to stretch simulation box
in.lj.volume_npt	use "volume control" with constant pressure

** class2

23-atom phenyalanine molecule with MSI/Biosym cff95 class 2 force field
see data.class2 for listing of force field parameters
non-periodic, isolated molecule

in.class2.newton3	default newton flag = 3 (fully on)
in.class2.newton0	newton flag = 0 (fully off)
in.class2.newton1	newton flag = 1 (off for nonbond)
in.class2.newton2	newton flag = 2 (off for bonded terms)

** lc

250-atom single liquid-crystal molecule (data.lc.small)
6750-atom collection of 27 molecules (data.lc.big), a 3x3x3 array
	created via tools/replicate.c program

in.lc.small.periodic	one molecule in periodic box
in.lc.small.nonperiodic	one molecule in vacuum (non-periodic)
in.lc.small.restart.first  do a run that creates restart files
in.lc.small.restart.second  read one of the restart files and redo the run
in.lc.small.min		minimize one nonperiodic molecule, then dynamics
in.lc.big.cutoff	big system with a Coulombic cutoff
in.lc.big.ewald		big system with Ewald summation
in.lc.big.pppm		big system with FFT-based particle-mesh Ewald
in.lc.big.respa		big system with rRESPA turned on
in.lc.big.shake		big system with SHAKE fix applied to some bonds
in.lc.big.fixes		thermostat middle layer of atoms versus upper/lower
			(also shows how to write/use a diagnostic file
			if LAMMPS is compiled with diagnostic_temp_molecules.f
			the run will measure temperature of different
			layers and print it in log file)

** polymer

simulations of idealized bead-spring polymer chains
data files created with tools/setup_chain.f using def.* files
soft potentials are used initially to untangle the chains
the chains are modeled with LJ and FENE potentials

in.polymer.chain.a	16 50-mer chains
in.polymer.chain.ab	mixture of 2 chain types with different bead sizes
			and some free monomers

** flow

2d LJ system, periodic in x, atomic walls in y
contraints are used to induce flow in the x-direction (flow thru a channel)
data files created with tools/setup_flow_2d.f

in.flow.cold		Couette flow by moving cold upper wall atoms
in.flow.warm		Couette flow by moving warm upper wall atoms
in.flow.poiss		Poiselle flow by giving force kick to flow atoms
in.flow.hoover		thermostat flow atoms with Hoover/drag fix
in.flow.langevin	thermostat flow atoms with Langevin fix
in.flow.ave		squeeze inward with averaged forces on wall atoms
